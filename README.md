Daily DSA Practice

This repository contains my daily coding practice in **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** using **Java**.

I solve problems from platforms like **LeetCode and GeeksforGeeks** to improve problem-solving and prepare for coding interviews.

Topics Covered

- Arrays
  
- Strings
  
- HashMap / HashSet
  
- Linked List
  
- Stack & Queue


Folder Structure

Topic/ProblemName.java


Example:

Array/TwoSum.java

Strings/LongestSubstring.java


Goal
- Solve at least **1 problem daily**
  
- Track progress over time
  
- Build a strong **coding portfolio** for resumes
